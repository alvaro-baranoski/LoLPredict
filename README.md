# LoL Predict Project
This personal project aims to create a program where you can predict the result of a League of Legends match based on data from post draft. It uses Selenium to crawl data from op.gg and a model developed using H2O.ai framework to obtain the prediction results. The model uses the players' KDA, winrate and games played with a champion from both teams as input parameters, and outputs the prediction of which side (blue or red) should win the match.

## Todo
- Get more data to get a better model and prevent overfitting
- Use other input parameters such as player win/lose streak and champion data
- Fix project organization and data crawl eventual errors
